    <p><b>Prompt:</b> Generate a p5.js sketch that draws fractal Koch curves.  Add a slider to set
        the recursion level.  Use a canvas of 620x250 and have the initial line be 600 long.
        Make the slider range from 0 to 6 with an inital positon of 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this code, the KochCurve function draws the Koch curve. It first checks if the level 
        is greater than 0. If it is, it calculates the points of the smaller line segments that 
        make up the Koch curve and calls itself recursively on these smaller segments, 
        decreasing the level each time. If the level is not greater than 0 (meaning we've
         reached the maximum level of recursion), it simply draws a line from the start 
         point to the end point.
        </p>
        <p>
The draw function clears the canvas and then calls the KochCurve function with the start and end 
points of the line and the level of recursion. The level of recursion is determined by the 
value of the slider, which can be adjusted by the user.
</p>

This sketch will create a simple, straight Koch curve. You can experiment with changing 
the angle and start and end points to create more complex shapes. Note that 
due to the recursive nature of the Koch curve, higher levels of recursion 
can be very resource-intensive and may cause the sketch to run slowly.
