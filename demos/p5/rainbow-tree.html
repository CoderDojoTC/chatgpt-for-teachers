<b>Prompt:</b>
Generate a single p5.js sketch file that draws a fractal tree  on a black 400x400 canvas.<br/>
Add sliders to control the length of branches, and the angle of the branches.<br/>
Place the sliders at the bottom of the canvas with the label and value of the sliders to
the left and the sliders to the right.<br/>
Have the sliders span the width of the canvas less the width of the label and value.<br/>
Make each step of the tree have a color of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet).<br/>
Have the root of the tree have a stroke width of 7 and get smaller as you go up the tree.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Challenge:</b>
    Add two additional sliders that control the depth of the recursion and number of branches.
