    <p><b>Prompt</b>
        Create a single file p5.js sketch that tests a drawAnimatedWire() function.

        function called drawAnimatedWire(x1, y1, x2, y2, speed1, state)
        that will display small circle moving down the wire.

        The input parameters are:
        
        * x1, y1: the begging point of the animated wire
        * x2, y2: the ending point of the animated wire
        * speed1: the speed of the electrons moving down the wire
        * state: the state of the wire (on or off)

        The function should use the millis() function with a modulo to draw the process
        of electrons down the wire.

        Draw four wires in a square to demonstrate the drawAnimatedWire() function.

        Add a on/off button at the bottom of the canvas that turns the circuit on
        and off.

        Add a range control slider to change the animation speed.
