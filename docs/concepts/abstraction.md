# Teaching Abstraction

Our focus is students that are around 10 years old.

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science, and it is important for students to understand it early on in their programming education. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the important details of a problem, while ignoring the less important details. This can make programs more efficient and easier to understand.

There are a number of ways to teach abstraction to 10-year old students. One way is to use analogies and metaphors. For example, you could compare abstraction to building a house. When you build a house, you don't need to worry about the individual atoms that make up the wood, bricks, and concrete. You just need to know how to put those materials together to create a structure that meets your needs.

Another way to teach abstraction is to use examples from everyday life. For example, you could ask students to think about how they would describe a chair to someone who has never seen one before. Students would need to identify the important features of a chair, such as its shape, size, and function. They would also need to ignore the less important details, such as the color of the chair or the material it is made of.

Once students have a basic understanding of abstraction, you can start to introduce them to more complex concepts, such as functions and objects. Functions are blocks of code that can be reused in different parts of a program. Objects are collections of data and functions that represent real-world objects.

Teaching abstraction can be challenging, but it is an important skill for students to learn. By understanding abstraction, students will be able to write more efficient and easier to understand programs.

Here are some additional tips for teaching abstraction to 10-year old students:

1. Start with simple examples. Don't try to teach too much too soon.
1. Use analogies and metaphors to help students understand the concept.
1. Make it fun! Abstraction can be a dry topic, so try to make it as engaging as possible.  Try using graphics, colors and shapes in your labs.
1. Be patient. It takes time for students to master this concept.  Use repetition to reinforce these concepts.
