# Generative AI Interactive Demos

A large number of subjects in a high school curriculum can be enhanced with the use of interactive charts or simulations. Here are a few examples:

**Physics:** Many concepts in physics, such as Newton's laws, motion, gravitational force, electrical circuits, waves, and quantum mechanics, can be difficult to understand from a textbook. Simulations can provide a hands-on understanding of these concepts and phenomena.

**Chemistry:** Molecular structures, reactions, periodic table trends, and the concept of moles and stoichiometry can be easier to grasp with interactive visualizations.

**Biology:** Processes like cellular respiration, photosynthesis, DNA replication, meiosis and mitosis, and ecosystem interactions can be better explained using interactive charts or simulations.

**Mathematics:** Topics like geometry (shapes, angles, transformations), calculus (derivatives, integrals), and statistics (probability distributions, hypothesis testing) can be better understood with the help of interactive visualizations.

**Geography:** Understanding the physical layout of continents, countries, and cities, as well as climatic zones and ocean currents, can be greatly aided by interactive maps.

**Economics:** Concepts like supply and demand, market equilibrium, effects of fiscal and monetary policy, and international trade can be explained using interactive graphs.

**Computer Science:** Algorithms and data structures can be better understood by visualizing them. Coding concepts like loops, functions, and recursion can also be visualized.

**History:** Interactive timelines can be a great way to understand the sequence of historical events, how they overlap, and their impact on each other.

**Earth Science:** Simulations can help in understanding geological processes such as plate tectonics, the water cycle, or weather patterns.

**Astronomy:** The movement of celestial bodies, phases of the moon, solar and lunar eclipses, or understanding constellations are much easier with interactive simulations.

These are just a few examples. The potential for interactive teaching and learning is vast and can enhance understanding and retention of complex concepts across virtually any subject.

## Using Generative AI To Generate Interactive Simulations

In the past, most learning happen when students read books and listened to lectures.  Today
we can use generative AI to generate fun and exciting interactive web pages that
allow students to interact with their subjects.

There are many libraries of tools to allow us to use tools like ChatGPT to generate these
web applications directly from our prompts.  We just need to know what library to reference
and how to test the apps that generative AI generates.

## Matter.js Ball Bounce Example

Matter.js is a tool that does simple physic simulations.

## Cartesian Coordinate Drawing

### Prompt: 

```linenums="0"
Generate a cartesian grid drawing using SVG.  Create an SVG canvas of 400x400.  Place the origin in the lower-left corner.  Draw grids that are solid lines ever 100 and dashed lines every 50.
```

## Processing

Processing is a tool for doing 2D animations.  I want to thank Val Lockhart and Troy Peterson for suggesting we use ChatGPT to generate processing code.
