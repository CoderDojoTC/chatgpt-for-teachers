# Journey Maps for Lesson Plans

![](../../../img/journey-map.png)

A journey map is a graphical map of how students will navigate your course.  It is often
represented as a series of steps that are connected through a set of links.  Journey
maps are an alternative to single-path outlines of your courses or lessons.
They reflect the notion that there are often may ways to approach a subject
and they offer more freedom to encourage to explore what topics interest them
the most.

For many less structured classrooms, journey maps allow students to quickly 
see the steps they have completed and resume
where they left off.  Journey maps can also allow people to skip over 
the content they are already familiar with and take alternate routes if their curiosity leads them
in another direction.

Journey maps, typically are used in fields like user experience design and service design.  
They are a visual or graphic interpretation of an individual's relationship with a product,
 service, or organization over time and across different channels. They can also be a 
 valuable tool in the education sector, providing a framework to enhance lesson 
 planning and delivery. Here are are just a few ways you can use Journey maps in
 your classroom:

1. **Understanding Student Perspective:** Just as in user experience design, where journey maps help understand a user's interaction with a product, in education they can help understand a student's interaction with a lesson or curriculum. They provide insight into students' experiences, pain points, moments of engagement or disengagement, and areas where they might struggle or excel.
   
2. **Planning:** Journey maps can be used as a planning tool for designing a lesson or a unit. They can help educators map out key learning points, activities, assessments, and potential obstacles, making it easier to structure a lesson plan that is engaging and effective.


3. **Personalization:** Journey maps can be tailored to individual students, helping educators personalize instruction. For example, a journey map could visualize a student's learning process, identifying when they might need extra support or enrichment. This can help teachers better understand and meet the unique needs of each student.
   
4. **Reflection and Improvement:** After a lesson is delivered, journey maps can be used 
as a tool for reflection. Teachers can map out what actually happened during a lesson, 
compare it to the planned journey, and identify areas for improvement. 
This can be especially beneficial for ongoing professional development.

5. **Communication:** Journey maps can be used to communicate a student's
learning progress to other stakeholders, such as parents or other educators.
 They provide a clear, visual way to share information about a student's learning journey.


6. **Engaging Students:** Journey maps can also be a tool to engage students in their own learning. Students can create their own journey maps to reflect on their learning process, understand how they learn best, and identify areas where they might need more help.

In essence, using journey maps in lesson planning involves seeing the learning process from a student's perspective and using that understanding to design more effective and engaging lessons. They provide a concrete, visual way to plan, implement, assess, and improve instruction.
