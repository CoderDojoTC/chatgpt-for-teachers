# Battery Circuit

In this lesson, we will create an animation of a circuit that includes:

1. A battery
2. An on/off switch
3. A resistor
4. An LED
5. Wires that connect the components in a series loop

We will use the [Animated Wire](./wire-animate.md) demo that we did in a prior lab.

We will break the problem down into ChatGPT prompts that animate and test individual components.
We will then concatenate the components into a main animation file.
