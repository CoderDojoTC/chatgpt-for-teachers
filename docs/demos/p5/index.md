## Sliders

Sliders are the input range controls that allow users to change a value.

1. A single slider on a 400x400 canvas with label and text value. This demo
controls the radius of a circle.<br/>

1. Two sliders on a 400x400 canvas that control width and height of a rectangle.

Students that are learning charts and plotting will learn about the slope and intercept of a line.
This one is tricky since processing uses the upper-left corner as the origin and y increases as
we move down the page.</br>
