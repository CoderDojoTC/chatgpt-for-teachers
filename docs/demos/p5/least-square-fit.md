# Least Square Fit

Although the least-squares fit algorithm is simple, 

## Prompt

```linenums="0"_
Create a single p5.js sketch JavaScript file on a 600x400 canvas.
DO NOT generate any python code.
ONLY return a single p5.js file.
The file will be an interactive demonstration of a least squares fit for home sales data.
Generate 20 sample home sales and plot them.
Have all the home sales be within 10% of a least-square line that shows home price increasing with square footage.
Have the square footage range from 1,500 to 3,500 square feet.
Have the price of homes range from $150,000 to $500,000.
Put home price on the vertical axis.
Put square footage on the horizontal axis.
Draw a line that is calculated using the least-squares fit.
Add sliders for both the slope and the intercept.
Place the sliders under the plot.
Label the slope and intercept and show the value using the text() function.
