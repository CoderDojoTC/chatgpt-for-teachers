    <h1>Logic Simulator</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Prompt:</b>
        Create a single p5.js sketch using a 400x400 canvas.<br/>
        The sketch is a simulation of two simple logic gates, one "AND" and one "OR".<br/>
        There are two input wires on the left.<br/>
        Label the inputs "A" and "B" using size 16 black text.<br/>
        Draw input A as a horizontal line at y=50.<br/>
        Draw input B as a horizontal line at y=150.<br/>
        Have both input wires connect to both the "AND" and "OR" logic gates.<br/> 
        The top gate is a Boolean "AND" operation.<br/>
        The bottom gate is a Boolean an "OR" operation.<br/>
        Add two input toggle buttons on the left side to control the state of the inputs.<br/>
        Initialize the initial states of the inputs to be off.<br/>
        When a wire is high, draw it in red.<br/>
        When a wire is at ground, draw it in black.<br/>
        Place a label "AND" in size 16 point test on the "AND" gate.<br/>
        Place a label "OR" in size 16 point text over the "AND" gate.<br/>
