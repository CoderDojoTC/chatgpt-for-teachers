        <b>ChatGPT Prompt:</b>
Generate a p5.js sketch file of a simulation of a static pulse width<br/>

modulation (PWM) waveform on a 300x600 canvas.<br/><br/>

Add a range control slider to adjust the duty cycle of the waveform <br/>
with a default value of 50%..  The min should be 0% and the max should be 100%.<br/>
 Make sure the range control slider has a width of 400px using the style attribute.<br/>

At the end of the draw() function add a text() function that displays <br/>
the label and value of the duty cycle.<br/><br/>

<b>ChatGPT Explanation:</b><br/>

This sketch creates a simple sinewave that toggles between two heights to create a PWM waveform. 
The height of the waveform is determined by the duty cycle, with the waveform 
being "high" during the "on" period and "low" during the "off" period. The duty cycle is 
controlled by a slider, and the current duty cycle is displayed at the bottom of the sketch. 
The nf() function is used to format the duty cycle as a percentage with two decimal places.
<br/><br/>
By multiplying TWO_PI by cycles in the map function, we can adjust the frequency of the waveform. 
By increasing the number of cycles to 10, 
the waveform now completes 10 full cycles across the width of the canvas.
