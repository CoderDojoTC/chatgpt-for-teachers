# Multi-pointed Star

Here is a p5 sketch that generates a multi-pointed star.  

[Multi-pointed Star](./star.html)

Here is the prompt I used to generate
this program.

```linenums="0"
Generate a p5.js sketch that draws a star at the center of a 400x400 canvas.

Add a slider for the number of points on the star that ranges from 4 to 20
with a default of 10.

Make the slider width be 360px and display the label and number of points by using the
text() function at the end of the draw() function.  Place the label, value and
slider at the bottom of the canvas.
