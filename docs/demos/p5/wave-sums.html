        <b>ChatGPT Prompt:</b>

        Create a p5.js sketch that draws four sine waves of different frequencies<br/>
        and then draws their sum at the bottom of a 400x600 canvas.<br/><br/>

        Create a function called drawWave(x,y,width,height, freq) that will<br/>
        draw each of the first four waveforms to be added.<br/><br/>

        Add a checkbox in each of the first four waveforms called with the label "Include in sum".<br/><br/>

        When the user check the box in each waveform, add it to the waveform<br/>
        at the bottom of the canvas.<br/><br/>

        Put a bounding box around the first four waveforms.

        Make the height of each of the first four waveforms be 80 and leave
        a 10 pixel margin between the waveforms.<br/><br/>

        Label the bottom sum waveform "Sum of Waveforms".  Make the label be 16pt.<br/>
        Make the first four waveforms have a strokeWidth of 1.<br/>
        Make the strokeWidth of last sum be 4.
