# Wire Animate

### Wire Animation

![](./../../img/animate-circuit.gif)

When animating circuits, we need an animation of electrons moving down a wire.  In
this lesson, we use ChatGPT to generate a function to help us
draw a wire that has an animation of small circles (think electrons) going through the wire
when the wire is carrying a current.

Requesting ChatGPT to generate an explicit function is a great way to break larger
problems into smaller tasks that ChatGPT can be successful at.
