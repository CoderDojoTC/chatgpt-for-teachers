# AI in Education Today

Despite the wonders in productivity that spell checkers, grammar checkers and Large-Language-Models have given us, they have fundamental limitations.  They have no "models of the world" in their memory.  They can't really simulate the consequences of their decisions.  They are only "smart parrots" that repeat what they have been trained on and combined this knowledge in ways that are useful.

Here are some of the challenges in AI:

1. **Data bias:** AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased or incomplete, then the AI system will produce biased results.
1. **Explainability:** Many AI systems, especially deep neural networks, are considered black boxes, meaning that it can be challenging to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of transparency makes it challenging for humans to trust and use AI systems in critical applications.  Humans can make recommendations and give you detailed reasoning about why they recommend specific decisions.  
1. **Generalization:** AI systems often perform well on tasks they were trained on, but they may not generalize well to new tasks or domains. This means that AI models may need to be retrained for every new use case.
1. **Ethics and morality:** As AI systems become more advanced and start making decisions that impact people's lives, ethical considerations become more critical. There is a need for guidelines and regulations to ensure that AI is used ethically and for the benefit of humanity.
1. **Energy consumption:** The human brain only consumes about 12 watts.  This is about the power
 of an energy-efficient LED lightbulb.  AI systems require significant amounts of computing power, which can lead to high energy consumption and carbon emissions.  Training GPT-3 was estimated to take over
  1.2 gigawatt hours.  This is a concern given the pressing need to address climate change.
