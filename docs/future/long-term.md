# The Long-Term of AI in Education

Now let's pause and reflect on what the world of education might look like ten years from now.  We anticipate that the cost of language understanding will drop to almost zero and the quality of the models will be 1,000x what it is today.

## Super-Intelligence

Around the year 2030, we expect to see AI systems that will be able to not only understand our language but plan and analyze learning strategies in ways we can't anticipate today.  We also anticipate that almost everyone will have access to these systems.  We hope that access to low-cost adaptive learning will be commonplace.

## Rapid Feedback Systems

One of the key limitations of today's systems is their limited ability to scan the brain and see if new concepts have landed in our brains.  We expect low-cost non-invasive brain-scanning systems to provide feedback and adaptive strategies to help students learn concepts faster and link concepts together.

## Hybrid Human-Machines

We also expect new innovative ways to communicate between human and machines potentially restructuring the connections in our brains to promote rapid learning.  Although we don't expect the ability to download programs like in The Matrix, we expect
