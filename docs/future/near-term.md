# AI Education in the Next Ten Years

## Language Understanding

In the next few years, we will be able to assume that low-cost language models will be able to be integrated into all our learning and desktop applications.

## Personalized and Adaptive Learning

AI systems will be used to create personalized and adaptive learning experiences for students.

Central to this will be the availability of low-cost knowledge graphs that understand educational concepts and their dependencies.  When these knowledge graphs can overlay what students already know and their learning objectives, learning management systems will be able to create precise recommendations on learning content.
This will allow students to learn more efficiently and effectively.

## Regulation and Existential Threats

We know that it can be difficult to predict how bad actors will use AI and if regulatory agencies will do their part to prevent harm from coming to individuals.  Just like regulators need to control access to our phone systems with tools like CallerID to prevent SPAM phone calls and fraudsters from calling us, regulators will need to aggressively prosecute organizations that are using AI for nefarious purposes.
20 years from now, it is almost impossible to know how technology will evolve. 

Many people feel that AI will become a threat to humanity and that future AI will decide that human beings are no longer needed to achieve their goals.  And we can't rule out that this will happen. But what we can do is make sure that the goals of humans will align with the goals of future AI systems.  Educating future students to put in guardrails for keeping AI safe is one of the key elements we will continue to teach.
