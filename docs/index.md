# Generative AI for Teachers

![Banner](./img/banner.png)

This is a course to help teachers use ChatGPT and other generative AI programs to generate content for their classrooms.  It is designed to be useful for a broad audience and we include an extensive [glossary](glossary.md) for people that are new to the field of [generative text](#generative-text).  Our goal is to demonstrate a wide variety of uses of generative AI from simple lesson plans to generating lesson-appropriate online interactive simulations.
