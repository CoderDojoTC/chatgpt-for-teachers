# Using ChatGPT to Select the Right License

There are hundreds of licensing options for you when you put your course information on the web.
But which license is right for you>

## Why should we be concerned about licenses?

You may put a lot of work into your course only to have someone else resell it for money.  
That might not be fair to you.
You also want other teachers to use your materials but acknowledge the work you did with attribution.

## Legal Issues

Here are the top three issues.

1. **Sharing with other teachers** - do you want other teachers to reuse and remix your work?
2. **Attribution** - do you want others to recognize your work?
3. **Non-commercial** - is it ok if a commercial publisher takes your work and sells it.

## Sample Prompt

```linenums="0"
I am a teacher that is creating new lesson plans.  I want other teachers
to be able to reuse my content and modify it for their classrooms. 
However, I want them to give me attribution and I don't want anyone
to be able to resell my content.

What creative commons license should I use?
```

## Sample Response

The Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license would be the best option for you. This license allows others to reuse and modify your content for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give you attribution and share their modified content under the same license. It also prevents anyone from reselling your content.

You can then look-up this name and provide a link to it:

[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
