# Glossary of Terms

One of the best ways for students to validate they understand a topic is to
view the terminology used in the lessons.  Students can quickly
scan the terms and check to see if they understand the defintions.

Unfortunately, creating glossaries that have precise definitions
that are clear, consistent and age-appropriate takes time.  Luckily, 
ChatGPT can make these tasks much easier.  Here is an example.

## Prompt
