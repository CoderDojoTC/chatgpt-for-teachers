## Response

**Lesson Plan: Abstraction using Custom Blocks in Scratch**

### Grade Level: 4-6

### Objective:
Students will learn the concept of abstraction and how to create custom blocks in Scratch to abstract repeated code.

### Materials:
- Computers with Scratch installed
- Scratch accounts for each student
- Projector or interactive whiteboard
- Worksheet with exercises

### Introduction (10 minutes):
1. Begin by asking students if they have ever had to repeat a task over and over again.
2. Explain that repeating the same task can be tedious and time-consuming, and that programming allows us to automate repetitive tasks.
3. Introduce the concept of abstraction, explaining that it involves simplifying complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
4. Show examples of abstraction in everyday life, such as a recipe that breaks down a complex dish into a series of smaller steps.

### Activity 1: Creating a Custom Block (25 minutes)
1. Open Scratch and start a new project.
2. Explain that a custom block is a block that can be created by the user to perform a specific task.
3. Demonstrate how to create a custom block by selecting "Make a Block" in the "More Blocks" category.
4. Walk students through creating a custom block that draws a square with a specific size and color.
5. Show how the custom block can be reused to create multiple squares with different sizes and colors.

### Activity 2: Using a Custom Block (25 minutes)
1. Provide students with a worksheet that contains a series of tasks that involve repeating the same code multiple times.
2. Show students how to use the custom block created in Activity 1 to abstract the repeated code.
3. Ask students to complete the tasks on the worksheet, using the custom block to abstract the repeated code.
4. Circulate around the classroom to provide assistance and answer questions.

### Conclusion (10 minutes):
1. Recap the concept of abstraction and how it can be used to simplify complex tasks.
2. Ask students to share their experiences with creating and using custom blocks in Scratch.
3. Encourage students to continue exploring abstraction and custom blocks in their own projects.

### Assessment:
Students will be assessed on their ability to create a custom block and use it to abstract repeated code in Scratch. The worksheet completed in Activity 2 will be used to assess student understanding.

### Extension:
For students who finish early or are looking for an additional challenge, encourage them to create more complex custom blocks that can be used in other Scratch projects. They can also be asked to share their projects with the class and explain how they used abstraction to simplify their code.
