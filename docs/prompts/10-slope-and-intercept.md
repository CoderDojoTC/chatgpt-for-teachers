# Slope and Intercept

ChatGPT can be used to create interactive "hands-on" demos.  In this lesson we will generate
a program that will interactivly draw a line but allow the students to change the slope of the line.

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create an HTML page that allows students to change the slope of a line.
Add an input range control slider that goes from -2 to 2 and controls
a JavaScript variable called "slope".  When the slider moves, update
the slope of a line.  Use a 400x400 SVG Grid.
Place the origin in the lower left corner.
