# Slope and Intercept

ChatGPT can be used to create interactive "hands-on" demos.  In this lesson we will generate
a program that will interactivly draw a line but allow the students to change the slope of the line.

## Prompt for Slope

```linenums="0"
Create an HTML page that allows students to change the slope of a line.
Add an input range control slider that goes from -2 to 2 and controls
a JavaScript variable called "slope".  When the slider moves, update
the slope of a line.  Use a 400x400 SVG Grid.
Place the origin in the lower left corner.
```

## Response for Slope

### Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Line Slope</title>
    <script>
      var slope = 1; // initial value of slope
      
      function updateSlope(value) {
        slope = value;
        drawLine();
      }
      
      function drawLine() {
        var svg = document.getElementById("grid");
        var x1 = 0;
        var y1 = 400;
        var x2 = 400;
        var y2 = 400 - slope*400;
        svg.innerHTML = '<line x1="'+x1+'" y1="'+y1+'" x2="'+x2+'" y2="'+y2+'" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>';
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Line Slope</h1>
    <input type="range" min="-2" max="2" value="1" step="0.1" oninput="updateSlope(this.value);">
    <svg id="grid" width="400" height="400">
      <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="400" stroke="gray" stroke-width="1"/>
      <line x1="0" y1="400" x2="400" y2="400" stroke="gray" stroke-width="1"/>
      <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="400" y2="0" stroke="gray" stroke-width="1"/>
      <line x1="400" y1="0" x2="400" y2="400" stroke="gray" stroke-width="1"/>
    </svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

The following explanation was generated by ChatGPT:

This code defines a JavaScript variable called "slope" and two functions: "updateSlope" and "drawLine". The "updateSlope" function is called whenever the value of the input range control slider changes. It updates the value of "slope" and calls the "drawLine" function to redraw the line with the new slope.

The "drawLine" function calculates the endpoints of the line based on the current value of "slope" and updates the SVG element with a new "line" element using the "innerHTML" property.

The HTML code includes an input range control slider, an SVG element with a 400x400 grid, and four "line" elements to draw the grid. The origin is in the lower left corner, which means that the y-axis goes up and the x-axis goes to the right.

Here is what the user interface looks like:

## Advanced Version

Although generating a high-quality interactive app with over 50 lines is beyond the scope of
what ChatGPT can do today, you can break the program down into components and then
assemble the components together.  For example I wrote a prompt to display
the grid lines on a 400x400 grid and another to display the slope and intercept
values on the grid.

Here is a more detailed demo of this.
