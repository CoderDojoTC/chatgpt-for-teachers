# Prompts

A prompt is written instructions you give to a language model like
ChatGPT.  Prompts can begin as a short instruction such as *generate
a lesson plan on Python loops*.  If the results are not
what you want, then you can add more text.  The more context
you put in your prompts and the more specific you are about
what you want in the response the more you are likely to get
what you desire.

## Prompt Design Tips

Here are a few tips to help you get started.

### Give Context

*You are teaching a 6th-grade class in Python programming.
The students don't have any background in coding.*

### Specify Your Audience

*Generate an explanation of this program at the 8th-grade level.*

### Describe The Tone

*Use a relaxed and friendly tone.*

### Provide Examples

*Here is a sample list of colors:*

```py
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
```

*generate 10 more colors in this format*

### Use Precise Specific Phrases

Note: *There is a bug.*

Try: *There is a compile error on line 10.*
