Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the important details of a problem, while ignoring the less important details. This can make programs more efficient and easier to understand.</p> <p>There are a number of ways to teach abstraction to 10-year old students. One way is to use analogies and metaphors. For example, you could compare abstraction to building a house. When you build a house, you don't need to worry about the individual atoms that make up the wood, bricks, and concrete. You just need to know how to put those materials together to create a structure that meets your needs.</p> <p>Another way to teach abstraction is to use examples from everyday life. For example, you could ask students to think about how they would describe a chair to someone who has never seen one before. Students would need to identify the important features of a chair, such as its shape, size, and function. They would also need to ignore the less important details, such as the color of the chair or the material it is made of.</p> <p>Once students have a basic understanding of abstraction, you can start to introduce them to more complex concepts, such as functions and objects. Functions are blocks of code that can be reused in different parts of a program. Objects are collections of data and functions that represent real-world objects.</p> <p>Teaching abstraction can be challenging, but it is an important skill for students to learn. By understanding abstraction, students will be able to write more efficient and easier to understand programs.</p> <p>Here are some additional tips for teaching abstraction to 10-year old students:</p> <ol> <li>Start with simple examples. Don't try to teach too much too soon.</li> <li>Use analogies and metaphors to help students understand the concept.</li> <li>Make it fun! Abstraction can be a dry topic, so try to make it as engaging as possible.  Try using graphics, colors and shapes in your labs.</li> <li>Be patient. It takes time for students to master this concept.

Simulations can provide a hands-on understanding of these concepts and phenomena.</p> <p>Chemistry: Molecular structures, reactions, periodic table trends, and the concept of moles and stoichiometry can be easier to grasp with interactive visualizations.</p> <p>Biology: Processes like cellular respiration, photosynthesis, DNA replication, meiosis and mitosis, and ecosystem interactions can be better explained using interactive charts or simulations.</p> <p>Mathematics: Topics like geometry (shapes, angles, transformations), calculus (derivatives, integrals), and statistics (probability distributions, hypothesis testing) can be better understood with the help of interactive visualizations.</p> <p>Geography: Understanding the physical layout of continents, countries, and cities, as well as climatic zones and ocean currents, can be greatly aided by interactive maps.</p> <p>Economics: Concepts like supply and demand, market equilibrium, effects of fiscal and monetary policy, and international trade can be explained using interactive graphs.</p> <p>Computer Science: Algorithms and data structures can be better understood by visualizing them. Coding concepts like loops, functions, and recursion can also be visualized.</p> <p>History: Interactive timelines can be a great way to understand the sequence of historical events, how they overlap, and their impact on each other.</p> <p>Earth Science: Simulations can help in understanding geological processes such as plate tectonics, the water cycle, or weather patterns.</p> <p>Astronomy: The movement of celestial bodies, phases of the moon, solar and lunar eclipses, or understanding constellations are much easier with interactive simulations.</p> <p>These are just a few examples.

It is often represented as a series of steps that are connected through a set of links.  Journey maps are an alternative to single-path outlines of your courses or lessons. They reflect the notion that there are often may ways to approach a subject and they offer more freedom to encourage to explore what topics interest them the most.</p> <p>For many less structured classrooms, journey maps allow students to quickly  see the steps they have completed and resume where they left off.  Journey maps can also allow people to skip over  the content they are already familiar with and take alternate routes if their curiosity leads them in another direction.</p> <p>Journey maps, typically are used in fields like user experience design and service design. They are a visual or graphic interpretation of an individual's relationship with a product,  service, or organization over time and across different channels. They can also be a   valuable tool in the education sector, providing a framework to enhance lesson   planning and delivery. Here are are just a few ways you can use Journey maps in  your classroom:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Understanding Student Perspective: Just as in user experience design, where journey maps help understand a user's interaction with a product, in education they can help understand a student's interaction with a lesson or curriculum. They provide insight into students' experiences, pain points, moments of engagement or disengagement, and areas where they might struggle or excel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Planning: Journey maps can be used as a planning tool for designing a lesson or a unit. They can help educators map out key learning points, activities, assessments, and potential obstacles, making it easier to structure a lesson plan that is engaging and effective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Personalization: Journey maps can be tailored to individual students, helping educators personalize instruction. For example, a journey map could visualize a student's learning process, identifying when they might need extra support or enrichment. This can help teachers better understand and meet the unique needs of each student.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reflection and Improvement: After a lesson is delivered, journey maps can be used  as a tool for reflection. Teachers can map out what actually happened during a lesson,  compare it to the planned journey, and identify areas for improvement.  This can be especially beneficial for ongoing professional development.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communication: Journey maps can be used to communicate a student's learning progress to other stakeholders, such as parents or other educators.  They provide a clear, visual way to share information about a student's learning journey.</p> </li> <li> <p>Engaging Students: Journey maps can also be a tool to engage students in their own learning. Students can create their own journey maps to reflect on their learning process, understand how they learn best, and identify areas where they might need more help.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In essence, using journey maps in lesson planning involves seeing the learning process from a student's perspective and using that understanding to design more effective and engaging lessons. They provide a concrete, visual way to plan, implement, assess, and improve instruction.</p>"},{"location":"demos/js-graphics/journey-maps/#using-chatgpt-to-generate-journey-maps","title":"Using ChatGPT to Generate Journey Maps","text":"<p>One of the challenges </p>"},{"location":"demos/js-graphics/journey-maps/#online-image-map-editor","title":"Online Image Map Editor","text":"<p>Online Image Map Editor</p> <pre><code>&lt;map id=\"imgmap2023723133742\" name=\"imgmap2023723133742\"&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"42,47,230,164\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"320,46,501,165\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"592,47,773,167\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"861,46,1042,165\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"54,280,234,399\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"320,280,501,398\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"595,277,775,400\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;area shape=\"rect\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" coords=\"864,279,1044,396\" href=\"\" target=\"\" /&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Created by Online Image Map Editor (http://www.maschek.hu/imagemap/index) --&gt;\n    &lt;/map&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"demos/p5/","title":"Processing Examples","text":"<p>All of these p5.js examples were inspired by the wonderful Val Lockhart and Troy Peterson.

This lack of transparency makes it challenging for humans to trust and use AI systems in critical applications.  Humans can make recommendations and give you detailed reasoning about why they recommend specific decisions.  </li> <li>Generalization: AI systems often perform well on tasks they were trained on, but they may not generalize well to new tasks or domains. This means that AI models may need to be retrained for every new use case.</li> <li>Ethics and morality: As AI systems become more advanced and start making decisions that impact people's lives, ethical considerations become more critical.

We will be using the older (free) Python (not Python 3) for our labs.</p> <p>With turtle graphics, we usually draw on a standard screen that is 400x400 in size and the point (0,0) is in the middle of the screen so that <code>forward(100)</code> will move about 1/4 the length of the screen.</p> <p>When we need to turn a turtle, we need to give it a command such as <code>right(90)</code> that tells it to take a 90-degree right turn. We need 360 degrees to make a turtle turn fully around.</p> <p>The sample code on this page has a small \"copy code\" icon in the upper right corner of the screen. You can use this to copy the prompts into ChatGPT and the code into Trinket.</p>"},{"location":"prompts/09a-turtle-graphics/#draw-a-square","title":"Draw a Square","text":""},{"location":"prompts/09a-turtle-graphics/#draw-square-prompt","title":"Draw Square Prompt","text":"<p>We need to tell ChatGPT to use the Python turtle library.</p> <pre><code>Use the Python turtle library to draw a square.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"prompts/09a-turtle-graphics/#response","title":"Response","text":"<pre><code># GPT Prompt: Use the Python turtle library to draw a square.\nimport turtle\n\n# Create a turtle object\nt = turtle.Turtle()\n\n# Move the turtle forward by 100 pixels\nt.forward(100)\n\n# Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right\nt.right(90)\n\n# Move the turtle forward by 100 pixels\nt.forward(100)\n\n# Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right\nt.right(90)\n\n# Move the turtle forward by 100 pixels\nt.forward(100)\n\n# Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right\nt.right(90)\n\n# Move the turtle forward by 100 pixels\nt.forward(100)\n\n# Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right\nt.right(90)\n</code></pre> <p>Watch the turtle draw on Trinket.io</p> <p>Challenges</p> <ol> <li> <p>Can you ask ChatGPT to change the name of your turtle?</p> </li> <li> <p>Can you ask ChatGPT to use a for loop to draw the square?</p> </li> <li> <p>Can you ask ChatGPT to draw a square with a specific size and starting location?</p> </li> <li> <p>What other patterns can you draw?

You could collect data on how long you study and what grade you get on each test, then plot that data on a graph. Linear regression would help you find a line that best fits the points on the graph, which would help you see if there's a pattern or trend in the data.</p> <p>In everyday life, linear regression is used to make predictions about things. For example, if you're a farmer and you want to know how much corn you're likely to harvest based on how much fertilizer you use, you could use linear regression to find a line that best fits the data you collect on how much fertilizer you use and how much corn you harvest. Then, you could use that line to predict how much corn you're likely to harvest if you use a certain amount of fertilizer.</p> <p>Another example could be if a company wants to predict how much money it will make in the future based on its current revenue, it could use linear regression to find a line that best fits its revenue data. Then, they could use that line to predict how much money they will make in the future based on their projected revenue.</p> <p>Here is a sample dataset for linear regression that shows the price of houses based on their square footage:</p> Square Footage Price of House (in $) 1,200 150,000 1,500 175,000 1,800 200,000 2,200 250,000 2,600 300,000 3,000 350,000 <p>To create a formula that predicts the price of a house based on its square footage, we can again use linear regression.</p> <p>First, we need to plot the data points on a graph with the square footage on the x-axis and the price of the house on the y-axis. We can see from the data that there appears to be a positive correlation between the square footage and the price of the house.</p> <p>Next, we can use a linear regression calculator or software to find the equation of the line of best fit for the data points. This line will have the form of <code>y = mx + b</code>, where y is the price of the house, x is the square footage, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept.</p> <p>Using the sample dataset, the equation of the line of best fit would be: y = 83.33x - 10,000</p> <p>This means that for every additional square footage of the house, the price of the house increases by $83.33, and the initial price of the house (when x=0) is -$10,000, which is not realistic, so we can ignore the y-intercept in this case.</p> <p>So if you wanted to predict the price of a new house with a square footage of 2500 sq. ft., you could use the formula:</p> <p>y = 83.33(2500) - 10,000</p> <p>y = 208,325</p> <p>This predicts that the price of the house with a square footage of 2500 sq. ft. would be $208,325. However, it's important to note that this is just a prediction based on the data we have, and there may be other factors that affect the price of a house beyond its square footage, such as location, age, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and more.</p> <pre><code>import plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\n\n# create data\nsq_ft = np.array([1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 2600, 3000])\nprice = np.array([150000, 175000, 200000, 250000, 300000, 350000])\n\n# calculate line of best fit\nm, b = np.polyfit(sq_ft, price, 1)\nline = m * sq_ft + b\n\n# create plotly chart\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# add data points\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=sq_ft, y=price, mode='markers', marker=dict(color='blue')))\n\n# add line of best fit\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=sq_ft, y=line, mode='lines', line=dict(color='red')))\n\n# set axis labels and title\nfig.update_layout(title='Relationship Between House Price and Square Footage',\n                   xaxis_title='Square Footage (sq. ft.)',\n                   yaxis_title='Price of House ($)')\n\nfig.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"prompts/25-linear-regression/#story-telling","title":"Story Telling","text":""},{"location":"prompts/25-linear-regression/#prompt","title":"Prompt","text":"<p>Create a story about a student learning linear regression as it would be told by Joseph Campbell.</p>"},{"location":"prompts/25-linear-regression/#response","title":"Response","text":"<p>Once upon a time, there was a young student named Alex who was studying data science at a prestigious university.

The goal is to adjust the springs in such a way that the points are as close as possible to the line.</p> <p>In this analogy, the line represents the linear model that we are trying to fit to the data, and the points represent the actual data points. The springs represent the coefficients of the model that we adjust to minimize the distance between the data points and the line.</p> <p>We can think of the distance between each point and the line as the tension in the spring connecting the point to the line. Our goal is to adjust the springs (i.e., the coefficients) in such a way that the tension in each spring is minimized, or in other words, the distance between the point and the line is minimized.</p> <p>Through the process of linear regression, we adjust the coefficients (i.e., the springs) until we have the best possible fit between the data points and the line. This fit allows us to make predictions about the dependent variable (the points) based on the independent variable (the line).</p>"},{"location":"prompts/25-linear-regression/#generate-javascript-svg-demo","title":"Generate JavaScript SVG demo","text":"<p>We can now ask ChatGPT to generate an interactive JavaScript Demo:</p> <p>Linear Regression Demo with JavaScript and SVG - use your browser refresh to generate new values</p> <p>Linear Regression with Grid Lines</p> <p>Sliders for Slope and Intercept</p> <p>Least Squares V1</p> <p>Least Squares V2</p> <p>Least Squares V1</p>"},{"location":"prompts/25-scikit-learn/","title":"Scikit Learn","text":"<p>Scikit Learn is a Python library for predictive data analysis.
