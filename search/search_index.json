To use these materials you will need two things: A valid account on either ChatGPT or an account on the OpenAI Playground. Link to ChatGPT OpenAI Beta Playground A place to put the generated content. We suggest you use GitHub Pages if you would like to share your content with others. To use GitHub Pages you will need a GitHub account. Link to GitHub The way this course runs is that the instructor will show you a suggested prompt and then ask you to try that same prompt on your system. If you are happy with the results, you can then copy and paste the results into your website. Rendering Tools ChatGPT can only generate plain text. If you want to display graphics, tables and charts you will need to copy the text into another tool. No installation web-rendering tools Use these if you have only a web browser or Chromebook.

Assume the student has already had a basic introduction to Python and has had lessons on: 1. Syntax 2. Conditionals Generate sample Python code within markdown that will include an input list of colors (red, green blue etc.) and show how to loop through the list of colors to print them each out. Sample Response Below is the sample response. Because the response includes markdown and sample code, we don't make it a simple text object. Lesson Plan: Loops in Python Objectives Understand the concept of loops in Python Learn how to use loops to iterate through a list of items Create a program that uses a loop to print out a list of colors Materials Computer with Python installed Sample code Introduction Welcome to our lesson on loops in Python! In this lesson, we will learn how to use loops to iterate through a list of items. We will also create a program that uses a loop to print out a list of colors. What is a Loop? A loop is a programming construct that allows us to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. This is useful when we want to perform the same task on multiple items. For example, if we have a list of colors, we can use a loop to print out each color in the list. Types of Loops There are two types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops. A for loop is used when we know how many times we want to repeat the instructions. For example, if we have a list of 10 colors, we can use a for loop to print out each color in the list. A while loop is used when we don't know how many times we want to repeat the instructions. For example, if we want to keep asking the user for input until they enter a certain value, we can use a while loop. Sample Code Let's look at some sample code that uses a for loop to print out a list of colors. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Create a list of colors colors = [ \"red\" , \"green\" , \"blue\" ] # Loop through the list of colors for color in colors : # Print out each color print ( color ) The output of this code will be: 1 2 3 red green blue Practice Now it's time to practice writing a program that uses a loop to print out a list of colors. Create a list of colors and use a for loop to print out each color in the list. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Create a list of colors colors = [ \"red\" , \"green\" , \"blue\" , \"yellow\" , \"orange\" , \"purple\" ] # Loop through the list of colors for color in colors : # Print out each color print ( color ) The output of this code will be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 red green blue yellow orange purple Conclusion Congratulations!

Trinket is a free kid-safe website that runs you turtle graphs programs. In these labs, we will use ChatGPT to generate Python code and then we can copy the code and paste it into Trinket to test the drawing of the code. You might want to create your own account in trinket so you can save your work. We will be using the older (free) Python (not Python 3) for our labs. With turtle graphics, we usually draw on a standard screen that is 400x400 in size and the point (0,0) is in the middle of the screen so that forward(100) will move about 1/4 the length of the screen. When we need to turn a turtle, we need to give it a command such as right(90) that tells it to take a 90-degree right turn. We need 360 degrees to make a turtle turn fully around. The sample code on this page has a small \"copy code\" icon in the upper right corner of the screen. You can use this to copy the prompts into ChatGPT and the code into Trinket.

Can you ask ChatGPT to use a for loop to draw the square? Can you ask ChatGPT to draw a square with a specific size and starting location? What other patterns can you draw? Can you generate a triangle, a circle, a hexagon, an octagon and a five-pointed star? We learned that just by using a few functions such as forward() and right() that we can create some cool drawings! Random Squares Let's start with a simple program that draws a bunch of random squares on the screen. Random Squares Prompt #1 1 2 3 Use the Python turtle library to draw a set squares that are filled in with random colors. Place the squares randomly on the page.

It knows that humans like to see about 20 items on a screen and that a reasonable size of screen is about 400x400 with (0,0) being right in the middle of the screen. This program kind of works. But all the squares are filled with black! Not very colorful. Now lets take a look at what went wrong and how we can give ChatGPT a little hint at how to create better code for us. Fixing the Prompt As a background, there are two different \"standards\" for drawing color levels. One sets the color level in a range of 0 to 1. The drawing library within Trinket uses a color range of 0 to 255. But we didn't tell ChatGPT we were using the 0 to 255 standard so the following lines: 1 2 # Set the random color t . fillcolor ( random . random (), random . random (), random . random ()) The function random.random() generates a random decimal number from 0 to 1 are not correct for Trinket. Here is the correct version: 1 2 # Set the random colors as r,g,b values that are integers from 0 to 255 t . fillcolor ( random . randint ( 0 , 255 ), random . randint ( 0 , 255 ), random . randint ( 0 , 255 )) We could manually fix this by scaling the colors by 255. But that means that we would have to also fix all the other code we generate. How can we tell ChatGPT that we need our color ranges in the range of 0 to 255? The answer is we just add one additional sentence to the prompt. \"Use a color range of 0 to 255.\" Here is the new prompt: 1 2 3 4 Use the Python turtle library to draw a set squares that are filled in with random colors. Place the squares randomly on the page. Use a color range of 0 to 255. Forcing a Function The program above is nice, but it hard to read and hard to figure out where the logic of the square drawing starts and stops. What if we wanted to write a program that draws both squares and circles at random locations. The answer is to force ChatGPT to create a function that draws the squares. We will need to modify the prompt to explicitly ask ChatGPT to create a draw_square() function and tell it to use color, x and y as input parameters. Force Function Prompt 1 2 3 4 Use the Python turtle library to draw a squares of different colors at random locations. Create a function called draw_square that has inputs of color, x and y.

Sample Prompt 1 Design a low-cost robot to teach STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) concepts. Use low-cost parts so all students could program their own robots with MicroPython. Response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 The robot design should include: 1. An affordable chassis made from lightweight material such as plastic or cardboard. 2. A motor controller that can be programmed with micropython to control the robot\u2019s movements. 3. Two DC motors with encoders that provide feedback on the robot\u2019s speed and direction. 4. Sensors such as an infrared distance sensor, light sensor, and touch sensor for the robot to interact with its environment. 5. An onboard battery to power the robot. 6. A USB port to connect the robot to a laptop or other device for programming with micropython. 7. A low-cost microcontroller with enough memory to run micropython code. 8. A set of instructions and sample programs to get students started with programming their robot. We agree with everything but a small detail of #3. We find that DC motors only cost about $1.50 each. But motors with encoders usually run around $15.
